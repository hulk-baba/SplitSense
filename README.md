# SplitSense
A webapp to Share expenses among friends. This app has features of simplifying debts and keeping a record of one's give and take. Sharing expenses is very commom daily problem, where people need to maintain who owes whom what. SplitSense does that for us.

### Description of Technology and  Algorithm
Project uses LAMP(Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) stack and C++ app to perform the alogrithmic computation. ***Simplifying debt*** feature which, when used gives the minimum number of transactions to settle the bills. I
used a simple greedy algorithm in C++ to implement this feature using priority queues and used PHP to serve web pages and
dynamic data. Used MYSQL to store transactions and users. A dashboard of the project can be seen [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/poly-screenshots.angel.co/Project/81/414867/12097a6fc7cb1835f5ab1435e248deb9-original.png).
